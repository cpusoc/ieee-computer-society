<p>Hear from the most even of Stephens! Stephen Pruett is one of Yale Patt’s graduate students and was a UT ECE undergraduate student too. He’ll be talking about graduate school and his experience as both a UT undergraduate and graduate student and the similarities and differences between the two. If you’re interested in graduate school, this talk is for you. Bring your questions!</p>
