<p>The IEEE Computer Society is hosting a VR Workshop for making Google Cardboard apps on your phones! There will be a short introduction to how to get started developing, then you guys can be creative and work on your VR app. We'll be walking around and try to answer whatever questions you might have, and help you with your projects!</p>

<p>Please come in pairs or groups! We have some Google Cardboards to give out, but supply is limited. Having Unity or Android Studio installed is recommended. Snacks will be provided.</p>
