        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>The IEEE Computer Society at The University of Texas at
            Austin works to connect students who are highly interested
            in the field of computer engineering with companies who
            can provide insight to this industry. We find it extremely
            important that students be exposed to real world
            engineering projects, and assisting them in this endeavour
            is an essential part of what we do.</p>
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>The IEEE Computer Society is a collection of students and
            faculty that share an interest in the field of computer
            hardware and software.</p>
